## Introduction/Business Problem

This project is talking about the neighborhoods of New York. The major Target Audience would be business owners and stake holders who planning to start a Middle and high class  Italian restaurant in New York, this project would help them find the optimal location.  
The Foursquare API is used to access the venues in the neighborhoods. Since, it returns less venues in the neighborhoods, we would be analysing areas for which countable number of venues are obtained. Then they are clustered based on their venues using Data Science Techniques.

1. Due to the high cost of restaurant, this area should be one of the regions with high employment and high imcomes.
2. Hope as many consumers as possible patronize the restaurant, so there should be a large and dense population nearby.
3. Since this is an Italian restaurant, stay away from Italian restaurant as much as possible and in areas with high dining popularity.
4. Tourists and business travelers have high spending power, so it's important to close to the hotel, and not too far from the city center or other tourist hotspots.
5. To ensure the safety of constomers and restaurant staff, select a low-risk area.
